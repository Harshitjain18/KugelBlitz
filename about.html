    <h1>About KugelBlitz</h1>
    <p>
      We are a team of passionate educators, engineers, and AI enthusiasts, 
      driven by the desire to transform traditional learning. Our name, 
      <strong>KugelBlitz</strong>, is inspired by a concept where 
      intense energy creates a unique phenomenon—reflecting our ambition 
      to ignite new possibilities in education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our platform leverages advanced machine learning models to produce 
      detailed, step-by-step solutions for the most challenging questions 
      in Math, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. But we don’t stop at 
      answering queries: we strive to replicate the experience of having 
      a personal tutor who can adapt explanations in real time, address 
      misunderstandings, and offer personalized practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond academic assistance, we value curiosity and critical thinking. 
      We regularly share articles, tips, and video breakdowns that connect 
      classroom theories to everyday life, inspiring students to think big 
      and ask bold questions. In the near future, we plan to introduce 
      interactive modules, real-time progress tracking, and community-focused 
      study rooms that bridge the gap between virtual learning 
      and collaborative, in-person experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Join us in our quest to reshape how education is delivered. 
      With KugelBlitz, the brightest ideas are always just a spark away.
